          <p>
            What an interesting school. It's theme color is purple and is located at the heart of New York City.
            I entered the school for its liberal arts program, hence CAS, the College of Arts and Sciences.
            I, however, plan to major in computer science.

          <h3> Stuyvesant HS 2019 </h3>
          <p>
            I spent four years in this high school and first learned about and fell in love with computer science.
            The school had a lot of steps and floors (ten!)
