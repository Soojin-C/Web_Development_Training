        <h2> Subway Map(2019) </h2>
        <p>
          This project was made for AP Computer Science final project.
          The program is run from the terminal and finds the shortest path between stations.
          This program does not use real time data, but rather uses the relations of stops on subway lines to determine the best route.
          The best route is ultimately the the route with the least number of stops (or stations) in between.
          The user is prompted with various questions to determine their departing and arriving station.
          This program is meant to be used with a subway map, but if the user knows enough about the NYC Subway System or the exact stations they would like to depart/arrive to and what lines they are, a subway map is not necessary
        <h3> Features </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Finds the shortest route between two NYC Subway stations by using Dijkstra's algorithm </li>
          <li> Can specify the departure and destination station by subway line </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Built with: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Java backend </li>
